# US05 - As an HRM, I want to generate a team proposal automatically

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Human Resources Manager, I want to streamline the creation of proposals for highly-functional, versatile teams which collaborators need to have the skill set to perform the tasks properly.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>   "Human Resources Manager (HRM) - a person who manages human resources and defines teams based on the needs of ongoing projects and the skills of the employees."
>   Person who will automatise the generation of the teams.

>	"Teams are temporary associations of employees who will carry out a set of tasks in one or more green spaces."
>   Teams definition.

>   "When creating multipurpose teams, the number of members and the set of skills that must be covered are crucial."
>   Diversity of the teams to perform the tasks properly.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What information will the customer provide?
>
> **Answer:** The customer provides the max size of the team and a set of skills.

> **Question:** Should teams be static?
>
> **Answer:** No, we must be able to define teams without being static, and can be changed depending on the tasks.

> **Question:** Is HRM responsible for each team?
>
> **Answer:** The HRM manages and defines the teams that will carry out the tasks associated with the park.

> **Question:** What are the input data to automatically generate a team?
>
> **Answer:** the max size of the team (for instance 4) and the skill needed: 4 tree pruner and 1 light vehicle driver meaning that one team member have 2 skills.

> **Question:** What should the output of the automation be?
>
> **Answer:** The systems provide team proposals and HRM can accept of refuse the proposals. In the future (not in this sprint) HRM may decide to edit the team.

> **Question:** How does it generate the team if there are not enough employees?
>
> **Answer:** The system should provide information why it can't generate a team.
