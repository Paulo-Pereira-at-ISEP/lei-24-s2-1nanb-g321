> Green spaces are essential support for citizens' quality of life, as they promote biodiversity, recreation and leisure, in addition to sustaining and organizing the urban fabric.
> 
> They are promoters of ecological and cultural continuity, essential for environmental sustainability, which integrates resources as diverse as parks, gardens, partitioned hedges, trees in streets and in areas free from buildings that contribute to the construction of the “urban forest”.
>
>The management of water resources is also an important issue in the management of urban parks, which is why it is increasingly important to make appropriate use of this asset.
> 
>All of this is not possible without people, which is why adequate management of human resources, in order to value them, keep them motivated and efficient, is also of great importance.
> 
>Today, it is increasingly important to make correct use of the technology we have at our disposal. In the information age, companies need to use IT solutions to remain competitive, with an environmental and sustainable focus and to develop low-price, added-value products.
> 
>The application developed by our team, the context of which will be explained in the following pages, aims to facilitate the management of urban parks within the scope of personnel management, team management, equipment, vehicles and respective maintenance and tasks.

## <a id="sysov"></a> System Overview 
[top](#top)

>Our application, hereinafter referred to as the system, is a comprehensive management tool specifically designed to address the multifaceted needs of public park management entities. It is crafted to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and optimize the management of human resources, equipment, vehicles, green spaces, and quality assessments.
>
>The system offers robust human resources management capabilities, maintaining a detailed database of employees, tracking individual attributes such as skills and qualifications, and assisting in the scheduling and allocation of tasks based on availability and competencies. This ensures that the right personnel are assigned to the right tasks, enhancing operational efficiency.
>
>In terms of equipment management, the system keeps an up-to-date inventory of all equipment, tracking their status, location, and condition. It schedules and monitors routine maintenance and repairs to ensure that all equipment remains in optimal working condition, and it monitors usage patterns to identify trends and optimize equipment utilization.
>
>The system also provides comprehensive vehicle fleet management. It maintains detailed records of all vehicles, including specifications, purchase details, and current status, and tracks maintenance schedules and histories to ensure timely servicing and repairs. By monitoring vehicle usage patterns, the system helps optimize fleet operations, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.
>
>A key feature of the system is its green spaces management module. This module maintains detailed records of all green spaces, including size, location, plant species, and maintenance needs. It creates tasks for green space maintenance, which initially appear in a to-do list with a pending status. These tasks are then moved to an agenda where they can be tracked through different statuses such as planned, doing, done, and postponed. This ensures that all maintenance activities are systematically planned and executed.
>
>Additionally, the system includes a quality assessment manager. This feature maintains a database of quality assessments for various areas and activities within the park, defining and tracking criteria such as cleanliness, safety, and visitor satisfaction. It generates reports on these assessments, helping to identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.
>
>As a decision support tool, the system can automatically generate teams based on parameters such as required skills and the number of team members needed. It provides recommendations for the optimal allocation of human and material resources and analyzes data to generate insights into workforce performance, equipment efficiency, and vehicle utilization. This ensures that resources are used effectively and that decisions are based on comprehensive, data-driven insights.
>
>The system is designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for managers to access and utilize the various features. It includes dashboards, reports, and visualizations that provide quick insights into operations and supports both desktop and mobile access to facilitate management on-the-go.
>
>By integrating comprehensive management capabilities with advanced decision support tools and additional features for quality assessment and green spaces management, the system significantly enhances the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of public park management entities. It streamlines management tasks, saves time, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures that high standards are met and maintained, ultimately leading to better-managed parks and more satisfied visitors.

#### Below are troubleshooting steps for each user story (US), focusing on common issues that might arise and how to resolve them.

### US01 - Register Skills for a Collaborator
**Issue:** Skill name contains special characters or digits.
**Solution:** Ensure that the skill name only includes alphabetic characters. Remove any special characters or digits before saving. Implement a validation rule to check for these characters before submission.

### US02 - Register a Job for a Collaborator
**Issue:** Job name contains special characters or digits.
**Solution:** Similar to skills, ensure that the job name contains only alphabetic characters. Add a validation step that restricts the input to letters only and alerts the user if the job name contains invalid characters.

### US03 - Register a Collaborator
**Issue:** Invalid taxpayer identification number or citizen card number.
**Solution:** Verify the format and length of the taxpayer identification number and citizen card number. Ensure they meet the national standards for validity. Implement real-time validation and provide immediate feedback if the entered details are incorrect.

### US04 - Assign Skills to a Collaborator
**Issue:** Unable to assign skills to a collaborator.
**Solution:** Ensure that the collaborator and the skill both exist in the database. Check for database connectivity issues. Validate that the skill assignment logic correctly associates the selected skills with the chosen collaborator.

### US05 - Generate a Team Proposal Automatically
**Issue:** Incorrect team size or skill set.
**Solution:** Confirm that the HRM inputs valid numbers for the minimum and maximum team size and that the skill set provided matches the existing skills in the database. Ensure the team generation algorithm respects these constraints and properly handles edge cases.

### US06 - Register a Vehicle
**Issue:** Missing or incorrect vehicle information.
**Solution:** Ensure all required fields (Brand, Model, Type, etc.) are filled with valid data. Implement validation checks for fields like dates and numerical values. Provide clear error messages if any field contains invalid data.

### US07 - Register a Vehicle’s Maintenance
**Issue:** Maintenance entry fails to save.
**Solution:** Verify that the vehicle ID exists and is correctly referenced in the maintenance record. Ensure that all required maintenance details are provided and correctly formatted. Check for database write permissions.

### US08 - Produce a List of Vehicles Needing Maintenance
**Issue:** Report fails to generate or displays incorrect data.
**Solution:** Ensure the data retrieval query accurately selects vehicles due for maintenance based on their current kilometers and maintenance frequency. Verify the report formatting logic to display the vehicle details correctly.

### US20 - Register a Green Space
**Issue:** Green space details not saved correctly.
**Solution:** Confirm that all required fields are filled in and correctly formatted. Check for database connectivity and write permissions. Ensure the area measurement is accurate and within acceptable ranges.

### US21 - Add a New Entry to the To-Do List
**Issue:** Unable to associate the entry with a green space.
**Solution:** Ensure that the green space selected by the GSM exists in the database. Validate that the entry form correctly links the new entry to the chosen green space. Check for errors in the dropdown list population logic.

### US22 - Add a New Entry in the Agenda
**Issue:** To-Do list entry not found.
**Solution:** Ensure that the entry exists in the To-Do list before attempting to add it to the agenda. Validate that the agenda entry form correctly references the existing To-Do list entry.
