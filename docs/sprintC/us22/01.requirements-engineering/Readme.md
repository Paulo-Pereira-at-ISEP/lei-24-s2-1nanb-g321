# US22 - As a GSM, I want to add a new entry in the Agenda.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a GSM, I want to pick a task from the to-do list and add it to the agenda for the weekly scheduling.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>	"Green Spaces Manager (GSM) - the person responsible for managing
the green spaces in charge of the organization."
> 
> Person responsible for adding the task to the agenda.

>  "The Agenda is a crucial mechanism for planning the weekâ€™s work."
> 
> Definition of agenda.

>  "Each entry in the Agenda defines a task (that was previously included in the to-do list).
A team will carry out that task in a green space at a certain time interval
on a specific date."
> 
> Definition of entry (task), shows the order of planning of tasks (to-do and then agenda).

>   "Comparatively analyzing the Agenda entries and the
pending tasks (to-do list) allows you to evaluate the work still to be done,
the busyness of the week, and the work performed by a team in a green space
at a determined time interval and on a specific date."
> 
> Usage of agenda



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When the GSM plans a task (that was previously in To-Do) into the Agenda, what aditional data/information does he need to input when planning?
>
> **Answer:** The starting date for the task.
