### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>   "The Agenda is a crucial mechanism for planning the weekâ€™s work. Each entry in the Agenda defines a task (that was previously included in the to-do list)."

>   "A team will carry out that task in a green space at a certain time interval on a specific date."

>   "Comparatively analyzing the Agenda entries and the pending tasks (to-do list) allows you to evaluate the work still to be done, the busyness of the week, and the work performed by a team in a green space at a determined time interval and on a specific date."

>   "US22-AsaGSM,I want to add a new entry in the Agenda."
